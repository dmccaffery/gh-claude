# gh-claude

A [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) extension that launches [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
with a **temporary, least-privilege GitHub token** so Claude can work with your
**private repositories** without ever seeing your real credential.

The token is:

- **read-only on source code** (no `git push`),
- **read/write on issues and pull requests**,
- **scoped to all repositories you can access**,
- **expiring after 7 days**, and
- **stored in your OS keychain** (or an encrypted file where no keychain exists, e.g. WSL2),
  with [1Password as an optional alternative](#using-1password-optional).

Claude only ever receives the scoped token through the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable — it never touches your keychain or your real `gh` credential.

## Why a manual browser step?

GitHub has **no API to mint a fine-grained personal access token** — they can only
be created in the browser. (The fully-automated alternative, a GitHub App, would
require shipping an app private key to every developer machine, which we explicitly
avoid.) So `gh-claude` automates everything *except* the creation click: it opens
the token page **pre-filled** with the right name, 7-day expiry, and permissions;
you choose "All repositories" and click **Generate**; and from then on the
extension stores, reuses, validates, and wires up the token for you. You only
repeat the browser step about once a week, when the token expires.

## Install

```sh
gh extension install bitwise-media-group/gh-claude
```

Requires the `gh` CLI (authenticated), `git`, and the `claude` CLI on your `PATH`.

## Usage

```sh
# Ensure a valid token (reuse or create), then launch Claude in the current dir:
gh claude

# Pass arguments through to claude after `--`:
gh claude -- --resume

# Force-create a fresh token without launching Claude:
gh claude login

# Show the stored token's account, expiry, and where it is stored:
gh claude status

# Remove the stored token:
gh claude logout

# Force a new token, then launch:
gh claude --refresh

# Store the token in 1Password instead of the OS keychain (see "Using 1Password"):
gh claude --op
```

On first run (or after expiry) your browser opens to the GitHub token page. In it:

1. Under **Repository access** choose **All repositories**.
2. Leave the pre-filled permissions: **Contents: Read**, **Issues: Read and write**,
   **Pull requests: Read and write**.
3. Click **Generate token** and copy the value (starts with `github_pat_`).
4. Paste it back into the terminal (input is hidden).

The extension validates the token, records its exact expiry (from GitHub's
`GitHub-Authentication-Token-Expiration` response header), stores it, and launches
Claude. Subsequent runs reuse the stored token until it is within 5 minutes of
expiry or has been revoked.

## How gh and git are wired

When launching Claude, `gh-claude` adds to the child process environment only
(your global git config and `gh` keychain entry are never modified):

- `GH_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` — set to the scoped token. `gh` prefers these over
  its keychain, so Claude's `gh` uses the scoped token and never reads the keychain.
- A per-process git credential helper, injected via git's `GIT_CONFIG_*`
  environment mechanism, pointing at `gh auth git-credential`. `git` then defers to
  `gh`, which returns the scoped token — so `git clone`/`fetch` over HTTPS work for
  private repos, while `git push` is rejected (the token is read-only on contents).

## Security model

- **Claude never sees your keychain or real credential.** It receives only the
  scoped, read-only-code token via an environment variable.
- **No push.** The token's `contents: read` scope means code cannot be pushed,
  bounding the blast radius if the token leaks.
- **Short-lived.** Tokens expire after 7 days; reuse stops 5 minutes before expiry.
- **Env-var exposure.** As with any `GITHUB_TOKEN`, the value is readable by your
  own processes (e.g. `/proc/<pid>/environ` on Linux). This is inherent to the
  env-var delivery model; the read-only scope is what limits the risk.
- **WSL2 / no-keychain fallback.** Where no OS keychain is reachable, the token is
  stored in an encrypted file (mode `0600`) under your config directory. The
  encryption key is derived from a stable machine identifier (`/etc/machine-id`);
  this is defense-in-depth, **not** a hardware-backed secret — the machine id is
  not itself secret, so the file's permissions are the primary protection. Run
  `gh claude status` to see which backend is in use.

## Using 1Password (optional)

If you prefer to keep the token in [1Password](https://1password.com) instead of
the OS keychain — handy for a consistent store across machines, and a real secure
store on **WSL** (where there is otherwise no keychain) — `gh-claude` can store the
token there via the [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/) (`op`).
This is **opt-in** and does **not** replace the OS keychain; the keychain/encrypted-file
backends remain the default when you don't enable it.

**Prerequisites:**

1. Install the [`op` CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) and
   the 1Password desktop app, and sign in.
2. Enable the desktop app integration: 1Password → **Settings → Developer** →
   **Integrate with 1Password CLI** (turn on *"Connect with 1Password CLI"*). On
   **WSL**, follow 1Password's [WSL setup](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/about-biometric-unlock/#turn-on-biometric-unlock-in-the-cli)
   so `op` in your distro talks to the Windows desktop app.

**Enable it** with the `--op` flag (available on every command):

```sh
gh claude --op                          # use 1Password for this launch
gh claude --op --vault "Engineering"    # choose a vault (default "Private")
gh claude login --op                    # works on subcommands too
gh claude status --op                   # Storage:  1password (vault: Private)
```

Or set it once for the shell session with environment variables:

```sh
export GH_CLAUDE_STORE=1password      # opt in (also accepts "op")
export GH_CLAUDE_OP_VAULT="Private"   # vault to use (name or ID; default "Private")
export GH_CLAUDE_OP_ACCOUNT="my-team" # optional: account for multi-account setups
```

Flags take precedence over the environment variables, and the token is stored as
an item named `gh-claude:github.com`.

The token is kept in a single concealed field of an *API Credential* item, and is
only ever passed to `op` over stdin (never on the command line). Accessing it
prompts for 1Password's approval (biometric/system unlock, valid for a short
inactivity window). When `GH_CLAUDE_STORE` is set but `op` is missing or not
signed in, `gh-claude` fails with a clear error rather than silently falling back.

## Development

The `Makefile` is the entry point (`make help` lists every target). The Go developer
CLIs (golangci-lint, govulncheck, gotestsum, gocover-cobertura, addlicense, goreleaser,
syft) are pinned in `tools/go.mod` and run via `go tool` — no separate installs.

```sh
make pr        # full local gate: tidy, license headers, fmt, lint, test, build
make ci        # exactly what CI runs: lint, test, build
make lint      # addlicense + golangci-lint + govulncheck (check mode)
make test      # unit tests with coverage → coverage/
make build     # build ./gh-claude
make install   # build and install as a gh extension for end-to-end testing
make snapshot  # local release snapshot (binaries + SBOMs, no publish/signing)
```

## Continuous integration & automation

This repo uses the org's reusable workflows (thin callers in `.github/workflows/`):

- **`ci.yaml`** — runs `make lint/build/test` on every push and PR and uploads coverage.
- **`security.yaml`** — CodeQL analysis of the Go module and the Actions workflows.
- **`merge.yaml`** + **`merge-review-ack.yaml`** — fast-forward `/merge` and `/auto-merge`
  flows that preserve commit signatures.
- **`dependabot-merge.yaml`** — auto-approves and fast-forwards Dependabot minor/patch PRs
  once CI is green (config in `.github/dependabot.yaml`).
- **`merge-notice.yaml`** — posts a one-time `/merge` explainer on new PRs.

The merge automation requires the org's "FF Merge" GitHub App (the `FF_MERGE_CLIENT_ID`
variable + `FF_MERGE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret) and branch protection that requires PR review.

## Releases

Releases are driven by [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please)
through the org's reusable release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yaml`):
Conventional Commit history keeps a release PR up to date, and merging it cuts the
`vX.Y.Z` tag and a draft GitHub release. [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com)
(`.goreleaser.yaml`) then adopts that draft and uploads the per-platform binaries
named `gh-claude-<os>-<arch>[.exe]` — the exact asset names `gh extension install`
and `gh extension upgrade` match on — alongside `checksums.txt`, keyless
[cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) signatures, SPDX SBOMs
([syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft)), and a SLSA build-provenance attestation
over the checksums. Verify the provenance with:

```sh
gh attestation verify --owner bitwise-media-group gh-claude-<os>-<arch>
```
