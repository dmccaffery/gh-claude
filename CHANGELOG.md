# Changelog

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/dmccaffery/gh-claude/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0) (2026-07-19)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **store:** the encrypted file-backend on-disk format changed. Tokens stored by earlier versions cannot be decrypted and are treated as absent, so users on the file backend (all Linux hosts, and macOS/Windows release builds that fell back to it) must re-run `gh claude login` once after upgrading. Tokens expire after 7 days regardless, so this is a one-time re-auth.

### Features

* add a hidden docs command that generates the CLI reference ([b5d1566](https://github.com/dmccaffery/gh-claude/commit/b5d1566976db8b1e73c3e240a186473bd907ca00))
