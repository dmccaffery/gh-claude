# gh-claude — a `gh` CLI extension. Everything lives in mise tasks: the go-cli
# archetype (build/lint/test/release machinery + pinned tools) comes from the
# shared toolchain submodule at .mise/, selected in the root mise.toml;
# tasks.toml carries the repo-local tasks (docs, install, policy), the
# main.version build stamping, and the pr gate that regenerates the docs.
# This Makefile is only the thin forwarding shim — `make <task>` == `mise run <task>`.
